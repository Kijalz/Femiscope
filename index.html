                            <p class="mb-4">At our core, we believe in the power of mentorship to change lives, especially for adolescent girls in underprivileged and marginalized communities. These young girls face a multitude of social injustices that expose them to harmful cultural practices such as gender-based violence (GBV), female genital mutilation (FGM), early pregnancies, early marriages, and challenges related to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).

Our mission is to provide a safe, supportive space for these girls, where they can find guidance, encouragement, and resources to overcome these barriers. We use an intersectional approach to identify their unique challenges and design bespoke programs that address their specific needs. By fostering a sense of community and empowerment, we aim to help them develop a positive self-image, achieve higher aspirations, and ultimately break the cycle of vulnerability.

Through mentorship, educational initiatives, and advocacy, we are dedicated to creating a world where every girl has the opportunity to reach her full potential. We invite you to join us in this transformative journey, where together, we can make a lasting impact on the lives of these young girls. Follow us for updates, events, and inspiring stories of empowerment and resilience. 

Letâ€™s work together to ensure that no girl is left behind.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-0">In 2022, I was inspired to utilise mentorship as a tool to bridge the existing gender gaps in education among adolescent girls. After having multiple conversations with a few adolescents in my community, it was clear that most of the girls lacked the knowledge or idea of how to align their aspirations and dreams with what they were studying in school. Most of them had unclear ambitions coupled with misleading/misguided road maps that would lead them further from their aspirations, as such, I was inspired to stand in the gap and offer first-hand mentorship based on my experiences â€“ both my successes and failures. </p>

<a href="#" class="h4">Empowering Adolescent Girls: The Launch of Femiscope Initiative in Githurai 44</a>
<p class="my-4">On March 30th, a significant step towards empowering adolescent girls took place in Githurai 
44, Nairobi, as the Femiscope Initiative was officially launched at Candlelight Academy. This mentorship program, spearheaded by its Founder and CEO, Sally Ndwiga, saw the convergence of 25 individuals, including adolescents, educators, and community members, all dedicated to uplifting the next generation of young women.The event was marked by insightful discussions and presentations from five speakers, among whom was the esteemed East African Champion, Moses Gichuho. Gichuho shared invaluable experiences and best practices in mentoring adolescents, laying a foundation for the Femiscope Initiative's mission.As the Founder and CEO of Femiscope, I led a group activity aimed at familiarizing attendees with the Intersectionality Approach.This approach, crucial in understanding the complex   layers of identity that shape adolescents, will serve as a guiding principle in matching   mentors with mentees. Through interactive sessions, participants gained a deeper insight   into the diverse identities that intersect within adolescents, equipping them with practical   strategies to address the challenges these young individuals face.  The success of the event resonated beyond its immediate impact, as I was extended   invitations by the school manager to engage with more adolescents and speak at future   youth events hosted by Candlelight Academy. This endorsement underscores the relevance   and efficacy of the Femiscope Initiative in addressing the needs of adolescents in the   community.  Furthermore, I extend my gratitude to the One Campaign for their collaboration, which   played a pivotal role in ensuring the success of the launch event. Such partnerships are vital   in amplifying the reach and impact of initiatives aimed at fostering positive change in society.  Looking ahead, the Femiscope Initiative stands poised to make a lasting difference in the   lives of adolescent girls in Githurai 44 and beyond. By harnessing the power of mentorship   and adopting innovative approaches like the Intersectionality Approach, we are paving the   way for a brighter, more empowered future for the next generation of women leaders.  Together, let us continue to champion the cause of female empowerment, creating a world   where every adolescent girl has the opportunity to thrive and realize her full potential.</p>
